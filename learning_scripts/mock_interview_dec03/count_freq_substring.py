1. Given a string composed of the characters A, C, G and T, count the frequencies of all three-letter substrings. 
Note that these substrings may intersect:

>>> string = “ACATCACA”
>>> frequencies(string)
>>> {
            “ACA”: 2,
            “CAT”: 1,
            “ATC”: 1,
            “CAC”: 1,
       }
