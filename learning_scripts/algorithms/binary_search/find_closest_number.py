"""
Given an array of sorted integers. We need to find the closest value to the given number

Array may contain duplicate values and negative numbers.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9}
Target number = 11
Output: 9
9 is closest to 11 in given array

Input: arr[] = {2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9}
Target number = 4
Output: 5

midpoint: 7
right of midpoint: 8 - 4 = 4
left of midpoint: 6 - 4 = 2

midpoint: 5
right of midpoint: 6 - 4 = 2
left of midpoint: 2 - 4 = -2

midpoint: 2
right of midpoint: 5 - 4 = 1
left of midpoint: -
